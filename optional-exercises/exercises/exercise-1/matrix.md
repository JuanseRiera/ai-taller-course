## Model Comparison Report

### Code Generation
| Criteria | Grok | Gemini | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Correctness | Great| Great | Gemini have a much detail explanation while Grok did exactly what we ask him which was to give us the functions with JSdoc documentation | 
| Code Quality | Great| Great | Similar algorithm | 
| Documentation | Great | Great | JSdoc is at the same level but Gemini gave more explanation outside JSdoc documentation | 

### Reasoning
| Criteria | Grok | Gemini | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Correct Answer | Great| Great | | 
| Explanation | Regular| Great | Gemini was directly on point, Grok even though he had the response in the begining tried to calculate stuff that we did not ask him to do | 

### Refactoring
| Criteria | Grok | Gemini | Notes |
|----------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Improvement | Great | Great | | 
| Explanation | Great| Great | Gemini gave 3 almost identical options but the first one was perfect | 

### Overall Impressions
- Best for code generation: Same
- Best for reasoning: Gemini
- Best for refactoring: Same
- Fastest response time: Gemini
- Personal preference and why: For this basic problems I would use Grok because it's cheaper and the responses are very similar. I would like to try with more complex non conventional problems.
